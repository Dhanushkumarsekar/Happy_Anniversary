        <p>
            Happy 1st Anniversary, my love ❤️
From the day you came into my life, everything started feeling more beautiful.
This one year with you is not just time… it’s a collection of smiles, memories, fights, care, and endless love.
You became my peace in chaos, my strength in weakness, and my happiness in every moment.
Every laugh we shared, every call we stayed on, every little ‘I love you’ — means the world to me.
Thank you for standing with me, understanding me, and loving me even on my worst days.
I promise to keep loving you more with every sunrise and every heartbeat.
No matter where life takes us, one thing will never change —
My love for you will always remain forever. 💖
        </p>
        <p >
            <br>I love you more than words can express.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, happy anniversary, my dear! 💖
